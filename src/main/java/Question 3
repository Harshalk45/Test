Problem 3: Multi-Tenant Data Isolation

       Ensuring data isolation in a multi-tenant application requires careful planning and implementation. 
       

Data Segregation:

        Separate Databases: Each tenant has its own database. This is the most secure form of segregation 
        but can be more expensive to maintain.

Schema-based Segregation: Use a single database with different schemas for each tenant. 

Row-based Segregation: Store all tenants' data in the same tables but add a tenant identifier to each row.

Access Control:

Authentication: Implement tenant-specific authentication to ensure users only access data belonging to their tenant.

Authorization: Use a role-based access control (RBAC) system to manage user permissions within each tenant.

Data Access Layer:
    Develop a data access layer that enforces tenant isolation by automatically applying tenant filters to every query. 

Encryption:
Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit. Each tenant’s data can have unique encryption keys to add an additional layer of security.

Audit and Monitoring:
    Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring to track access and changes to data. 
    Regularly audit these logs to detect and respond to unauthorized access.


Data Backup and Recovery:
   Maintain separate backup and recovery processes for each tenant’s data to ensure integrity and confidentiality during restoration processes.
